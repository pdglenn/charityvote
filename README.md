# charityvote
Final project for Information Organization Lab at the UC Berkeley School of Information. Charityvote -- now called VoteIt -- is a prototype of an online eCommerce platform that allows customers to vote on a proposed product design, for example a T-shirt, by committing to purchase whichever option receives the most votes. Highlights front-end and back-end web development and database design.
